        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In engineering research and applications, a major concern is to design mechanical, electro-magnetic, optical and thermal components with required functionalities. After the development in past decades, the experimental, analytical or simulation tools are able to determine the performance and functions of components precisely with parameters given.  However, the required functionalities are clearly given before the parameters are clarified. An obvious solution to this problem is developing inverse designing methods [1,2]. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In material science, the soft matters are attracting more and more attention due to their special performance in many fields. Different from traditional hard materials, soft matters are able to undergo large deformation under strain load and show high stiffness under impact load. Besides, some electro- magnetic and thermal sensitive soft matters give a light on new creations in robotics, sensors and wearable devices. With the help of additive manufacturing, decorated patterns or micro-structure can be formed in different scales of soft matter. These soft matters, containing different phases, are soft composites indeed that bring both more powerful functionalities and difficulties in designing. To solve these difficulties, machine learning algorithms are potential choices for its strong adaptability and predictability.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Until now, some advances have been gained by scholars in photonic functional materials where the artificial neural networks are able to reduce the burden in designing. A typical usage is made with tandem Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in designing photonic devices, owning a special transmission matrix [3,4]. Some scholars used composite ANN to realize optimization of 2D photonic devices [5,6]. Other works on waveguide systems [7] and integrated devices [8]. Some discussions on soft matter engineering are published [9].</p>
        <br>
        <p>In pre-research on soft laminate composites based on computational mechanics, some data predicting the instability behavior under given material parameter. In the data, when the laminate will get instable, which is represented by critical strain, and how it will get instable, which is represented by critical wavenumber, are related with material parameters. This dataset is a good foundation for developing machine learning systems. However, this dataset is not specially designed for machine learning, which means the following difficulties will appear: data consistency, data pre-process, post-process and experimental provement. To solve these difficulties, different neural networks may be tested. The figures illustrating the training of these networks. Since our data do not have a geological component, we will use some supplementary information to make geographic maps to fulfill the requirement. Soft matters are among hot topics in material science research, and a large amount of NSF funding has been awarded to various labs across the United States. We will visualize this popularity by making a map demonstrating the spatial distribution of labs receiving soft-matters-related fundings from NSF in recent months, and the amount of granted US dollars on this research direction in each state. Our map data will be pulled from the NSF archive on its official website.</p>
