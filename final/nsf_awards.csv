It will particularly focus on the synergetic role of geometry and length scales by investigating specific features such as hierarchy, periodicity and patterning in the microstructure and interfaces observed in some extraordinarily strong natural materials.  The research approach consists of: i) exploring, identifying and quantifying the contributions of the individual multiscale deformation mechanisms of the natural composites using a multiscale computational approach aided by specially designed experiments, ii) a biomimetic effort following a combined computational and prototype modeling approach that employs advanced 3D printing techniques, and iii) developing design guidelines, validated later by constructing materials that incorporate the most important microstructural features identified in (i) and (ii). Achieving these insights will uncover design rules to develop impact and damage tolerant materials.  <br/><br/>There is a strong demand for new paradigms of design and development of advanced high-performance structural materials with high strength and durability, low in cost and renewable with novel combinations of properties and qualities. We will study biological composite materials that can achieve high toughness without sacrificing stiffness and strength by control of nano- and microstructural features that significantly improve the mechanical performance of otherwise brittle materials.

Yet, unstable behavior involves a sudden change of the structure's geometry and the release of accumulated energy. Thus, a new way of thinking is emerging for using the unstable response of slender structures for purposes that seem to be rapidly increasing and diversifying. Cylindrical shells are among the structural elements most affected by instabilities (commonly seen as a negative trait) but their geometry provides unique opportunities for controlling their unstable response, which can display multiple unstable transitions in a recoverable manner. The research hypothesis is that cylindrical shells can be designed such that their unstable response is controlled through optimal geometric and material stiffness distributions on the shell surface. The research findings will create new possibilities for the development of materials and devices that use instabilities for applications such as sensing, actuation, control, energy harvesting, and energy dissipation; advances that in turn could also facilitate the development of novel smart, active and multifunctional materials and structures.

The features of interest are not the initial elastic stiffness or the first bifurcation load, but a response with multiple stable to unstable transitions, the equilibrium path loading stiffnesses, the released kinetic energy at critical point transitions, and the dissipated energy during cyclic loading. Topology and shape optimization techniques will be expanded to achieve the desired response and experiments will validate computational designs and finite-element based simulations. Analysis and design frameworks will be developed for axially loaded cylinders with controllable elastic postbuckling behavior. The key innovation will be proving that the elastic postbuckling response of cylindrical shells can be tailored through the design of material and geometric features on the shell's surface, thus transforming a behavior traditionally seen as undesirable into an opportunity for use in smart materials and structures.

Friction is the resistance to sliding between two solid surfaces that are in mechanical contact. These mechanisms operate at sub-micrometer length scales and involve complex mechanical interactions that are dictated by the surfaces' adhesion and roughness. The specifics of these mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. The new knowledge will lead to new strategies that can reduce energy wastage, for example in engines, due to friction. Additionally, the new knowledge in alliance with micro-fabrication techniques will allow engineers to create surfaces with tailored or tunable surface properties. Specifically, it will inform them which sizes, shapes and arrangements of surface features should be used in order to produce the desired frictional effects. Such ""structural surface engineering"" has the potential to galvanize scientific and technological breakthroughs in many disciplines. For example, it can drive the development of prosthetics that are capable of the human sense of touch, and increase the agility of the next generation of climbing robots for search and rescue missions.<br/><br/>The new knowledge will be derived by investigating the hypothesis that a significant fraction of friction involving elastomeric material surfaces is caused by the energy dissipated by mechanical instabilities that take place at the small-scale due to adhesion and surface roughness. The hypothesis will be investigated by studying a model family of continuum mechanics-based contact problems. Equations that connect the mean transverse contact force to the net normal contact force, adhesion and roughness parameters will be derived. By performing an asymptotic analysis of these equations it will be determined whether the mean transverse force remains finite, that is, whether friction type behavior emerges at the large-scale, as the roughness length scale in the problem is made infinitesimally small. New adhesive contact simulation techniques and experiments will be developed and used to guide and verify the theoretical work. Currently, surface mechanical phenomena, such as friction, are considered intrinsic properties and are described with phenomenological models. There is a very limited understanding of how surface phenomena are connected to small-scale mechanisms and parameters. The project aims to derive a micro-mechanics based, mathematical theory of friction. It will lead to fundamental advances required for creating a general, theoretical methodology for understanding how surface properties emerge at the large-scale as the smeared out effects of complex interactions that are hidden at the small-scale.",375000

Most micro-nano mechanical systems use silicon beams as their structural components. These beams are typically subjected to bending during operation. But silicon is brittle at room temperature. This limits the design space of silicon devices. Bending, however, localizes high stresses near the surface of the beams close to the anchors. In addition, the stresses decrease from the surface towards the middle plane of the beam, giving rise to stress gradients. The effects of small size, stress localization and stress gradient on the failure mechanisms of silicon remain elusive to date. Recent evidence suggests that silicon at small scale can be ductile (i.e., not brittle) at very high yield stresses. If so, then small size, stress localization and stress gradients together may offer the virtues of both ductility and high strength to silicon. Such failure resistance would present a yet untapped paradigm to the design space of silicon devices. A detailed understanding of the failure and deformation mechanisms of silicon at small scale under bending would be transformative for both semiconductor physics and industry, and will be a fundamental advance for the field of mechanics. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore the mechanics and mechanisms of deformation and failure in small silicon samples under bending by combining theory and experiments. The working hypothesis of the project is that dislocation is the primary mechanism of deformation in silicon under bending at small scale. Small samples are dislocation free. Small size and stress localization in bending offer high flaw tolerance against fracture. This is due to the low probability of flaw incidence in the small stressed region. Bending results in dislocation nucleation from the surface before any flaw induced fracture. These dislocations enter the bulk yielding the silicon. But the yield stress increases with decreasing size due to stress gradient. This hypothesis will be tested by undertaking three tasks: (1) mechanistic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of silicon samples under bending, (2) bending experiments on micro-nano fabricated single crystal silicon samples with various sizes and at different temperatures, and (3) in situ bending experiments in transmission electron microscopes (TEM) to reveal the mechanisms of deformation (in collaboration with Max Planck Institute at Dusseldorf, Germany). A novel micro mechanical stage will be developed for tasks 2 and 3. The research will be integrated with education and outreach activities involving K-12 to graduate students.",370668

Failure in these rubber-like materials governs design rules in applications ranging from transportation to biomaterials. Unlike many rigid materials, cracks in rubber-like materials can blunt macroscopically as the material undergoes large deformations. This complicates the stress state at the tip of the crack, which varies depending on the material. Current understanding of the failure mechanism cannot explain the energy differences in two different loading geometries, cutting versus tearing. Potential benefits include design criteria to serve as targets to guide the fabrication of new materials. Results can be generalized to describe puncture and insertion of needles in soft tissue; these failure mechanisms play a key role in diagnostics and guided-needle therapeutics.

To fully characterize each of these important features, the PI will supplement experimental mechanical failure data with in situ and post-mortem imaging, documenting crack tip radius, near-tip strain, and fracture mechanism. The mechanism map resulting from this experimental characterization will guide examination and, if necessary, re-interpretation of existing models describing the mechanical origin of tearing in highly deformable materials.

Surface properties of a material are important for many applications. The capability to design and control surface texture would open opportunities to realize material surface properties that are otherwise unavailable, such as smart surfaces with tunable adhesion and self-cleaning properties. One viable approach to controllable surface texture is to create surface wrinkles, which can be accomplished easily by mechanically compressing a thin film coating attached to a relatively compliant substrate material. Current understanding in this field is well-developed for situations when both the thin film and the substrate material are elastic. However, many practical applications involve polymeric materials that are not elastic, but either viscous or viscoelastic, with time-dependent mechanical properties. Furthermore, complex surface textures with localized folds may be achieved on polymer surfaces by increasing compression. This research will enable potential applications using wrinkle-textured surfaces for controlling wettability, friction and adhesion, as well as stimulus responsive smart surfaces in energy, healthcare, aerospace, and automotive industries. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves a collaboration between two institutions and across disciplines including mechanics, material science, and chemical engineering. The interdisciplinary collaboration will help broaden participation in research from diverse background and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>Past research on wrinkling has focused predominantly on thin films attached to soft elastic substrates.

The research team will perform both computational and experimental studies. A simple and elegant method will be developed to impose well-controlled large compressive deformation on polymer-supported thin films, which allows the effects of strain and strain rate to be examined independently. Numerical simulations based on finite element method will be conducted in conjunction with experiments to understand the underlying mechanisms and to predict formation of wrinkles and folding structures.

Fiber-reinforced polymer composites are made by combining a polymer together with strong reinforcing fibers. Both glass and carbon fibers are relatively expensive, man-made fibers.

There is a growing trend to use natural fiber reinforced composites in several commercial applications such as automobiles, building construction, sporting goods, and electronic goods. Although natural fiber composites are already used in several industrial applications, their use in load bearing applications is very limited due to their poor durability and mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength, crack initiation and propagation resistance. Multi-functional properties such as stiffness, strength and crack resistance, and damage sensing will be achieved by coating natural fibers with graphene and embedding short carbon fibers between the laminates. In addition, research will be performed to understand the damage evolution of the natural composites under various mechanical loads using the three-dimensional electrical conductive network generated by the embedded graphene and short carbon fiber elements.

This approach can give important qualitative insight, but for the theory to be predictive, it needs to be better connected to vessel physiology. An examination of VSMC cell biology suggests that the simple growth laws commonly used are unlikely to universally describe VSMC mechano-adaptation. For example, VSMCs readily switch between two phenotypes (contractile and synthetic) with markedly different behaviors. This switching is particularly pronounced during remodeling, both adaptive and maladaptive, suggesting that it is a key step in the mechano-adaptation process. Additionally, vascular dysfunctions, such as hypertension or atherosclerosis, can lead to long-term changes in the mechanical environment surrounding VSMCs. While the changes in matrix mechanics are often included in mechano-adaptation models, the effect of the change in mechanics on VSMC function is not.  The principal investigators hypothesize that phenotype switching plays an important measurable role in vascular smooth muscle mechano-adaptation, and that both phenotype and mecahno-adaptation dynamics are influenced by extracellular mechanical properties.

The wide spectrum of potential applications of graphene from nanodevices to space elevators necessitates understanding of the mechanisms of environment assisted cracking in graphene to prevent catastrophic corrosion cracking. The second objective of this project is to investigate if graphene can act as an anticorrosion coating to protect reactive metals against corrosion. The permeability and optical transparency of graphene has inspired its use as a protective layer of metals such as copper. However, the experimental results on this subject are very contradictory. Some experiments have indicated that graphene can stop corrosion almost completely, while the others have indicated that using a graphene coating can lead to a more extensive corrosion in the underlying metal.

Soft organic solids are known to fracture in a very different manner than standard hard solids (such as metals and ceramics).  The defining difference is that internal fracture in soft organic solids initiates through the sudden growth of inherent defects into large enclosed cavities/cracks (a phenomenon popularly referred to as cavitation).

This property can enable applications in a range of technologies, including light-operated microsurgical tools, display technologies integrated with touch feedback, and robotics that harness light for manipulation.  However, the mechanical force generated by these materials is small and the shape change during irradiation with light is difficult to control. The new shape change mechanisms will simultaneously generate fast response times and large forces during the transition between the shapes.  Therefore, the results of this research can enable new device architectures and bring these materials closer to widespread application, thereby benefitting the US economy and society.

Because cartilage relies on interstitial fluid for its mechanical and lubrication functions, unbalanced exudation necessarily leads to increased friction, cartilage wear, and joint disease. Fortunately, cartilage and joint space actually thicken during physical activity due to the recovery of interstitial fluid in healthy joints. The only, and accepted, hypothesis for this recovery is that ""dehydrated"" cartilage regions passively uptake fluid when they become exposed to the bath by contact migration. However, recent in-situ studies have shown activity-induced recovery comparable to that observed in-vivo without ever exposing the contact to the bath; the phenomenon is called ""tribological rehydration"" because it is induced by sliding rather than migration. These preliminary results suggested that the balance between interstitial fluid loss and recovery in active joints is regulated by the interaction between interstitial (within cartilage) and hydrodynamic (between cartilage) pressure fields. The present study tests this hypothesis using explant tribology experiments with in-situ confocal imaging to elucidate the mechanisms involved in tribological rehydration. The anticipated results will help reveal why physical activity is so important to joint health while informing ongoing efforts to design the next generation of bio-inspired joint replacement devices.  The investigators will recruit local high school seniors to participate in this research through the University of Delaware College of Engineering's K12 Outreach program.<br/><br/>Recent in-situ studies of cartilage in a convergent stationary contact area configuration have shown that friction decreases with increased speed, which supports the fluid film theory of joint lubrication. However, they also showed that cartilage simultaneously recovered interstitial fluid, which suggests that hydrodynamic pressures serve to restore hydration (via tribological rehydration) and the interstitial lubrication mechanism. Because existing theory relies on contact migration to expose dehydrated zones to the bath for recovery, the result also implies a fundamentally new mechanism by which joints maintain and recover joint space during activity. By quantifying the effects of physiological articulation amplitudes and contact stresses on passive and active recovery of cartilage, directly interrogating the interfacial and interstitial microfluidics associated with active-rehydration via in-situ confocal microscopy, and evaluating the influence of cartilage degradation on the rehydration of cartilage, this study aims to identify the limits of passive recovery and tribological rehydration in the physiological context and elucidate the mechanism underlying tribological rehydration. The anticipated results of this study will provide new insights into joint mechanics, disease etiology, and the design of new bio-inspired joint replacement systems.",399999

Semi-crystalline polymers are widely used in the packaging industry for their easy availability and low price. Yielding and strain hardening are two key characteristics of such polymers. We hypothesize that laminated films that combine materials with differing levels of yield strength and strain hardening will have superior strength and toughness. The research would have direct impacts on the packaging industry in developing high-performance packaging solutions using materials that are already used commercially. The research would also reduce the amount of materials in these packaging systems and therefore their environmental impacts.

We hypothesize that bonding yielding layers to strain hardening layers will (1) increase in strength and ultimate strain of laminate films, and (2) improve flaw tolerance and fracture toughness of the laminate films. The research will include fundamental and complementary computational and experimental studies to test these hypotheses. On the computational side we will use custom nonlinear finite element framework with a new constitutive model developed for yielding and strain hardening plastics. On the experimental side, we will work with commercial plastics that range from being elastomeric to highly yield-like.

The large substrate deformation is expected to lead to a strong coupling between the normal and shear loadings of the micro-pillars, as well as between neighboring pillars. Understanding this coupling will facilitate the search for optimal pillar arrangement to achieve desired adhesion and friction properties.  The PIs will develop a new experimental apparatus to achieve in situ mapping of the three-dimensional deformation fields in soft hydrogel substrates under contact, adhesion and friction.  The soft gel substrate serves as a model material to simulate biological tissue or other soft and wet materials.  The in situ deformation mapping capability will be combined with adhesion and friction tests and finite element modeling. The finite element model will connect the local micromechanics at the level of individual pillars to the global adhesion and friction, through an experimentally validated pillar-surface interface model.

In contrast, the mechanical properties of most synthetic soft wet adhesives are much inferior to their natural counterparts, which severely hampers their potential applications and innovations. Robust synthetic adhesives based on soft wet materials will find diverse applications in healthcare, biomedical, chemical and marine industries.

In particular, magnesium with a density low enough to make it 35 percent lighter than aluminum and 78 percent lighter than steel is perhaps the most appealing of these lightweight materials. Replacing steel structural materials with magnesium-based materials in automotive applications would boost fuel efficiency by more than 50 percent. However, magnesium's use remains fairly limited because of a gap in the knowledge of a phenomenon called twin-twin interactions. Twins are specific features in hexagonal materials that can occur from the nanoscale to microscale and responsible for what is called deformation twinning, which is a major mode of plasticity in magnesium and responsible for its low strength and poor deformability. This research will focus on understanding the effect of twin-twin interactions on the mechanisms of deformation in magnesium by performing modeling at multiple scales supported by experimental observations. The outcome will be a predictive model that would allow engineers and scientists to optimize the processing routes of hexagonal metals for specific structural and environmental applications.

As the individual crystals deform, dislocation interactions lead to the formation of self-organized dislocation microstructures or patterns. These patterns are believed to control the mechanical strength and failure of metals. They are also important in metal manufacturing as they provide the way to refine the material behavior through combined mechanical deformation and heating. Although dislocation patterns were observed long ago, there is currently no theoretical or computational framework for predicting their formation in metals under arbitrary deformation. This research aims to bridge this critical gap by implementing a computational modeling framework that explicitly represents dislocations and their interactions at the mesoscale based on the continuum dislocation dynamics method. Such a generalization will enable accurate prediction of material behavior in crystalline materials, and it will eventually lead to realistic models of the manufacturing processes of structural alloys.

Excessive internal damage can lead to failure and is unacceptable. While a number of established methods for internal damage measurement do exist, a team of engineers and materials scientists will explore a new approach by which micro-scale damage sensors in the form of small particles are directly embedded into critical parts. These are expected to increase nondestructive evaluation accuracy, thereby increasing the safety of aircraft, vehicles, trains, and potentially other important transportation infrastructure.

Residual stresses (nominally force divided by area) are caused by internal forces that remain even after all external loads are removed. Despite the fact that residual stresses can reduce the service life considerably, comprehensive and practical methods to determine them without destroying the parts do not exist. Current non-destructive techniques allow their quantification on the surface of the parts only. Thus, development of new materials or manufacturing techniques can be greatly helped by a thorough estimation of residual stresses that might develop during the processes. For example, residual stresses are extremely prevalent in additively manufactured parts and strongly depend on process parameters in a complex way that are not understood well. This award supports fundamental research in inverse computational methods based on the mechanics of materials to estimate residual stresses in both non-destructive and destructive fashions from the measurement of forces and surface displacements. Advancement in residual stress analysis will promote both opportunistic use and mitigation in the development of new materials and manufacturing processes, which will greatly enhance automotive, aerospace, defense, and nuclear industries.

For the development of the destructive approach, very thin sectioned samples will be retrieved from the polycrystalline specimens to relieve all residual stresses, with the implication that the thin slices will deform as a result. Subsequent loadings of the samples will be used to determine the heterogeneous, anisotropic granular microstructure of the material using mechanics-based mathematical models. Application of reverse deformation on the now known microstructure to retrieve the original configuration can then be used to predict the residual stresses in the given section of the material.

Reversible adhesives are designed to form temporary bonds, and ideally can be reusable and capable of strong bonding. Such reversible adhesives can find wide applications in vertical mounting and climbing, releasable wafer and chip handling, as well as reusable bio-integrated electronics. It is well known that reversible adhesion can be achieved through surface interactions such as van der Waals (vdW), capillary, and electrostatic forces as well as volume effects such as suction. Adhesion due to surface interactions has been well studied for gecko-inspired microfibrils with different tip shapes including the concave shape. But the contribution from suction has been widely neglected at microscale. However, manufacturing microfibrils with large aspect ratio can be expensive and time-consuming. If an array of meso-scale craters could provide combined high adhesive strength and reversibility, they may become a practical substitute for microfibrils. The results of this research will guide the design and optimization of cratered surfaces and give a definitive answer to the debate of the suction effect across a broad range of scales.

Tungsten belongs to the so-called body centric cubic (BCC) class of polycrystalline metals. One of the major problems with W and other BCC metals that makes them expensive and limits their even wider use is that they are very brittle at room temperature and, therefore, are very hard to machine or form into shapes using dies and other forming processes.

Layered materials are ubiquitous in our surroundings; they encompass graphite, mica, and two-dimensional solids (with an atomic-scale thickness), among many others. It has long been understood that for solids to deform, microscopic defects must be present. Up to quite recently these defects were presumed to be line defects called dislocations, a well-known and studied material defect. In 2016, however, research suggested that conventional wisdom was incorrect, or incomplete, regarding the deformation of layered materials. A potentially new micro-mechanism called a ripplocation, best described as an atomic scale ripple, was suggested as the governing mechanism. At the macroscale, a ripplocation would be a carpet ripple. Currently, little is known about these defects, their mechanics or behavior, and how to leverage them to create improved materials. This research investigates the mechanics of ripplocation through an integrated suite of modeling and experimentation at two length scales. The overall goal integrates fields of mechanics, materials science, and scientific computing to build a platform to engineer more advanced materials as well as provide fundamental knowledgebase to the technology sectors where layers materials are relevant, such as geo-technology and microelectronics.

According to dislocation theory, when the planes of layered solid materials are loaded and unloaded edge-on they will either reversibly deform, and return to their original form without dissipating any energy if it's an elastic material or they will remain permanently indented. Ripplocation behavior explains the third observed option, which is the material returning to its original form, while dissipating considerable amounts of energy. The goal of this work is to understand ripplocation mechanics at multiple levels, from the atomic, through molecular modeling and theory, to the macroscopic where layered solids will be indented. Results from molecular modeling to capture the fundamental physics of ripplocations will be leveraged to create a new ripplocation dynamics model. Indentation predictions, including both strength and microstructural deformation, from the model will be directly compared to and verified with results from atomistic modeling at the nanoscale and experimental indentation studies at the microscale.

This process is widely used in the fabrication of micro- to nano-scale thin film based devices, especially in the production of flexible electronics.  In current practice, the technique relies heavily on trial and error, which results in low yields. This is particularly true for the transfer of thin films with multiple layers or discrete structures, where damage and residual contamination are quite common. This award will focus on the fundamental study of detachment mechanics of thin film-substrate systems in a liquid environment. The outcome of this research will impact the design and execution of transfer printing process through development of simple steps and relationships for high, yet efficient, throughput. This research is an interdisciplinary study involving chemo-mechanics, materials science and manufacturing. Graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to and trained on a broad scope of education and skills, respectively. Undergraduate students form underrepresented groups will be actively recruited and a university program will be leveraged to perform K-12 outreach. <br/><br/>Transfer printing is emerging as a competitive technique in the delivery and assembly of thin films in manufacturing. Its working efficiency is inherently underpinned by the detachment mechanics of thin films from substrates. The liquid-assisted transfer printing technique could promote both yield and quality of the detachment of thin films and involves a synergistic interplay of external mechanical loading and chemical reactions at the solid-liquid interface. The project will conduct a comprehensive study of liquid-assisted interfacial detachment in film-substrate systems, where the presence of liquid water will react with interfacial materials, leading to a controllable and selective detachment of thin film layers. The outcome of this study will be two-fold: 1) a comprehensive chemomechanics theory of liquid-driven detachment mechanics, and 2) a hybrid computational modeling framework that bridges solid-liquid atomistic interactions (mechanism) and continuum phenomena of film detachment (structural function) with validation from experimental testing and theory. The research will impact the transfer printing fabrication technique by providing scientific and technological means to achieving efficient, quantitative throughput.",284209

Under these operating conditions, a large number of metallic materials develop voids that result in embrittlement and consequent failure. Void swelling occurs as radiation induces atomic defects that migrate elsewhere leaving clusters of vacant positions behind. These vacancy clusters form voids and grow continuously. The principal investigators' initial study shows just the opposite phenomenon, however: that is, voids in metals with existing nanoscale pores shrink rather than expand during radiation. This research will investigate this phenomenon and may add radically to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of radiation damage mitigation. A positive outcome will enhance the design of radiation tolerant nanoporous materials for advanced nuclear energy systems. In this project, special effort will be made to recruit female and other minority students. Additionally, collaborations with scientists at Argonne National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory will offer graduate students summer research experience at premier national labs. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand, via a combination of modeling and experiments, the fundamental mechanisms through which deliberately introduced nanovoids in nanoporous metallic materials can absorb and eliminate radiation induced point defects, and ultimately curtail void swelling significantly and alleviate radiation embrittlement. The innovative concepts put forward here are the possibility of utilizing nanovoids and their stress field to trap, store and annihilate various defect species associated with radiation damage, and restore the capability to absorb defects continuously. Furthermore, nanoporous metals may have enhanced plasticity in comparison to radiation embrittlement frequently observed in bulk fully-dense counterparts. This study integrates in situ radiation experiments with phase field modeling to investigate the kinetics of void swelling, and combine in situ nanomechanical testing with dislocation dynamics modeling to explore mechanics and plasticity of irradiated nanoporous metals.",541817

Fibrous materials also have potential engineering applications, as they are light in weight yet have high tolerance for damage. In both applications--human health and engineering--it is crucial to understand the relationship between structural properties, like fiber size and number, and mechanical properties, like stiffness and strength. This research will establish these crucial relationships, which will advance treatments to disease and enable engineering applications for fibrous materials. As many future applications of this research are in human health, there will be a need for future engineers to be trained in both engineering and biology. Therefore, an additional objective of this project is to enable students to apply principles from multiple different scientific fields to solve engineering problems.

Thus, advanced additive manufacturing with the capability of nanoscale engineering of materials being deposited can be envisioned.

A prototypical metamaterial consists of an assembly of structural elements in one or more geometric shapes, sometimes characterized by a hierarchy of length scales. One purpose for which metamaterials are frequently designed for is to achieve a medium that is capable of transferring sound in remarkably unique ways that are not found naturally. When sound propagates in a solid medium it gives rise to noise and vibrations that, in the long term, are responsible for structural deterioration and potentially catastrophic failure. The complexity and multiscale nature of metamaterials poses many computational challenges that have so far limited their use in real-world applications. This award supports fundamental research to develop mathematical and computational methods that will enable the design and simulation of metamaterials. The ability to design materials capable of controlling the propagation of sound can have major implications on the ability to achieve quieter, safer, and more durable transportation systems and infrastructures in the fields of aerospace, mechanical, civil, and biomedical engineering, thereby promoting the progress of science; advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare; and securing the national defense The educational part of this project involves developing new tools and exercises to help students visualizing engineering concepts and integrating them in the academic curriculum.<br/><br/>This research takes full advantage of the potential and unique features of fractional calculus to develop a computational continuum mechanics framework for the analysis of acoustic field transport in metamaterials.

The research will develop methodologies to synthesize fractional-order wave propagation models from fundamental principles and it will apply them to the design and performance prediction of periodic and random metamaterials. This research will develop key capabilities at both physical and mathematical level. At physical level, it will allow capturing and predicting anomalous acoustic field transport mechanisms that otherwise would be undetected. At mathematical level, it will develop methodologies to find exact or approximate analytical solutions that would transform the way inverse material-design problems are approached.

Magnesium alloys are some of the lightest metals and exhibit the very desirable high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight performance ratios. Moreover, these metals are nontoxic, which also underline their potential for biomedical applications. However, one major obstacle preventing magnesium alloys from a wider use is the limited understanding of their fatigue behavior--material behavior under repeated mechanical loads, which is unique among structural metals due to its complexity. This award supports a fundamental study of the fatigue behavior of magnesium alloys through direct experimental observations. The research will provide basic knowledge of the mechanisms of deformation that lead to failure due to fatigue, and a database of experimental observations to develop and validate material models essential for the engineering design of magnesium-based parts. The effort will promote the engineering science of light-weight, high-efficiency alloys; and advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and secure the national defense through cost-efficient applications in the automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and defense industries.  The research will be integrated into an education program involving both graduate and undergraduate students to facilitate an understanding of sophisticated scientific concepts in magnesium research. For example, an educational video with interesting experimental visuals and 3D animations will be developed for undergraduate students and public; and self-directed and open-ended projects with relevance to magnesium alloys will be integrated into the existing capstone senior design classes.<br/><br/>The characteristic fatigue behavior of magnesium alloys is the result of the existence of twins, twinning-detwinning activities, and their interactions with slips and grain/twin boundaries.  The overall objective of this research is to understand how twins and twinning-detwinning activities, respectively, contribute to fatigue damage in magnesium alloys. To achieve this objective, three types of experiments will be designed and conducted: 1) fatigue with no involvement of twins and twinning, 2) fatigue with significant involvement of twinning-detwinning, and 3) fatigue with pre-designed twins without involving twinning-detwinning. These experiments will be realized using a magnesium alloy with a strong texture, and a proper design of the stress state and loading history with respect to the material orientation.  Ex-situ experiments together with in-situ experiments using companion specimens will be conducted to facilitate microscopic characterizations. Fatigue microcracking with the influence of twins, twin-twin boundaries, and interactions of twining and grain boundaries will be observed to elucidate the major micromechanisms governing the fatigue processes. The results from the research will form a base to develop mechanism-based fatigue damage models for magnesium alloys and provide information for the design of magnesium alloys with improved fatigue resistance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",373644

Natural curvatures occur in many biological and engineered structures through differential swelling, heating, or growth. They are: induced by proteins along a cell membrane, critical to the eversion of a developing Volvox embryo, and incurred in residually stressed composite plates and shells. Since natural curvature can drastically affect the morphology of thin bodies and induce mechanical instabilities, this provides a means for creating adaptive, shape-shifting structures capable of growing, morphing, and transitioning between complex shapes. This award supports fundamental research on the mechanics of instabilities induced by a natural curvature within thin shells. Harnessing these concepts for technological applications may enable the design of adaptive metamaterials, soft robotic actuators, and structural materials capable of programmatically controlled shape-shifting. Thus, this project will advance the science associated with mechanical instability; and advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. This award also supports the further development of the digital inspiration, communication, and education (DICE) program. By placing an emphasis on visual, verbal, and written communication, this program will continue to enhance both the scientific communication of the next generation of scholars and broaden the participation of the general public through the creation and curation of open, online mechanics content.<br/><br/>This research will establish a fundamental understanding of how natural and spontaneous curvatures deform slender structures and soft materials. Its results will help engineer shells that are more robust against buckling, and facilitate the design of shells capable of changing between target shapes on command. The research will establish how natural curvature can provide shells with a knock-up factor against pressure buckling. The research team will utilize experiments that control curvature in soft materials through residual swelling in conjunction with a novel computational model based on a large deformation, rotation-free shell formulation. A fully nonlinear forward and inverse computational shell model to analyze shells with an evolving natural curvature will be developed and validated with experiments. Finally, an understanding of how locally applied natural curvatures deform soft shells will be established, enabling targeted shape-shifting that utilizes the computational modeling to inform the experimental design. This understanding may transform key technologies where shape-shifting materials are being intensely pursued for technological insertion, like soft robotics, deployable structures, and biomimetic design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",550711

In practice, however, the high-volume expansion of the host material due to lithium insertion/reaction results in large deformations and loads which can cause fracture, pulverization, and eventually device failure. This award will support research towards investigating the use of elastic instabilities, such as buckling, in the design of nano-architected battery electrodes. This research will promote the electrochemo-mechanical sciences by elucidating the way buckling can improve electrochemical and mechanical battery performance, and the degree of improvement. Critically, this research will enable experimentalists to rapidly prototype and test next generation electrodes as well as provide a clear guideline as to the potential benefits of these designs. Finally, the research performed is not restricted to Li-Ion electrodes but can improve our understanding of several chemo-mechanical systems such as systems for catalysis and solid oxide fuel cells amongst others, which will advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. The research will have a broad impact on U.S. education where it will aid in the training of a diverse group of next generation undergraduate and graduate students with a multi-disciplinary understanding of mechanics of solids and electrochemistry. The training of such future scientists is critical to the U.S. energy industry. Finally, the award will support outreach to underrepresented K-12 students through the development of hands on experiments on the physics, manufacturing, and deployment of Li-Ion batteries for clean energy storage.<br/><br/>The development of next-generation Li-Ion electrodes relying on lithium-metals will necessarily require the means of accommodating the large deformations which are incurred by these materials during the lithiation process. Elastic instabilities, in particular buckling, is one possible mechanism whereby deformation of the material can be accommodated with limited generation of stresses. At present, however, there is no numerical tool to enable the rational design of nano-architected electrodes that buckle. Our approach will make use of two types of model: i) a detailed three-dimensional, fully-coupled finite element model which accurately resolves the transient behavior of these complex systems under experimentally accurate electrochemical boundary conditions, and ii) a simplified reduced order model which integrates enough physics to provide a reasonably accurate estimation of the electrochemical performance at a fraction of the computational cost.

Moreover, when the size scale of contact between soft surfaces becomes small, liquid-like characteristics arise and it is unclear if solid or liquid descriptions are appropriate, limiting the design of soft surfaces. This award supports fundamental research that overcomes current challenges in measuring and describing friction of soft materials at the microscale. In addition to promoting scientific advancement, this new knowledge is important for a broad range of applications towards national health and prosperity. For example, insights from this work are expected to afford design guidelines for soft biomaterials, resulting in advanced biotechnologies and healthcare. Knowledge is also expected to offer routes to designing low-friction coatings to mitigating energy losses due to frictional drag for manufacturing or transportation applications. Additionally, the project will provide opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students in the cross-disciplinary areas of micromechanics, surface science, and materials science, through research in the PI's lab, with a focus on underrepresented students in STEM.<br/><br/>Macroscale friction of soft materials is often assumed to be mediated by microscale contact points, arising from surface asperities. Therefore, universally predicting friction arguably requires understanding the behavior of single microscale junctions. Although research has consistently shown that friction is related to normal loading, contact area, dwell time, and velocity, it is unclear how it is described as the length scale is decreased. At small scales, near the so-called elastocapillary length, surface tension becomes critical and liquid-like characteristics are expected, leading to large out-of-plane deformations and capillarity. To characterize how the above parameters relate to friction force and surface deformation, the PI will utilize an experimental method that combines lateral force measurements using an AFM with in-situ imaging of cross-sections via confocal microscopy. A model silicone will be used, allowing for systematic tuning of the modulus and elastocapillary length. Experiments that control the normal loading, velocity, dwell time, and interfacial tension, while measuring the contact area, out-of-plane deformations, and friction force, are anticipated to reveal when friction is described by solid and/or liquid-like mechanics. A map of static friction thresholds and kinetic friction mechanisms, such as smooth sliding or stick slip, will be generated and new knowledge will be applied to more comprehensively predict micro and macroscale friction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",304085

For example, coating the surface of a metal with single layer of graphene can effectively stiffen and strengthen the underlying material, as well as enable unusual friction and wear properties. The organized stacking of a graphene layer on another surface, each having different atomic arrangements, results in what is called a heterostructure.  Moire patterns form as a result of periodic arrangements of aligned and misaligned atomic stacking in the layers. These Moire patterns are the signature of modifications of the electric and mechanical properties of the stacked materials, and the origin of new heterostructure behavior. This study will advance the science of two-dimensional materials by creating new theoretical and experimental tools to: probe the mechanics of the Moire patterns at the atomic scale, discover new useful material behavior, and reveal strategies to leverage these properties at larger scales. The success of the project will advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by facilitating design and fabrication of advanced materials with superior properties. As part of the project, a Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math (STEAM) activity on the Art of Moire will be created for middle and high school girls through an extensive collaboration with the School of Arts+Design.

Understanding what chemistry is favorable at these boundaries could allow for improved engineering of the material and create new markets for applications as a high strength optical element. Achieving this goal will progress experimental mechanics; advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and secure the national defense.

To develop a mechanism-informed understanding of the mechanical behavior of spinel, this work bridges experimentally relevant length scales: from measuring fracture properties and grain boundary chemistry on single boundaries to predicting the fracture strength of large specimens and their property distributions. The project develops digital particle-tracking methods for mapping evolving strain during single grain boundary fracture experiments performed in situ in a transmission electron microscope. Cohesive zone models developed from associated finite element analyses can be correlated with measured grain boundary chemistries and misorientations. Grain boundary and bulk property distributions as a function of anisotropy can be observed at the mesoscale (dozens of grains). This allows us to define representative volume elements for use in a continuum analysis of the macroscopic samples.  At this scale, experimentally reasonable compositional gradients, residual stress gradients, and grain boundary property distributions will be used to predict the distribution of macroscopic strength.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",477336

Geopolymer composites are a new class of amorphous polymeric hybrids with attractive attributes that have the potential to drastically change the way composites materials are synthesized. Geopolymer-based hybrids are relevant to a vast array of fields such as civil, aerospace, mechanical, and biomedical engineering. However, established relationships between performance, chemistry, and composition are lacking. As a consequence, the widespread application of geopolymer-based materials has been impeded, despite their high potential. The integration of cutting-edge experiments with advanced computational modeling will accelerate the discovery of high-performance multifunctional structural composites. Geopolymer composites have been theorized for many interdisciplinary applications including enhanced-performance construction materials, passive cooling systems for buildings, biomaterials for bone repair, membranes for clean energy generation, and sound insulation systems. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U. S. economy and society, and spur materials discovery. This research involves the collaboration between three institutions and across disciplines including nanoscience, solid mechanics, and materials science. Comprehensive outreach activities will be implemented in collaboration with local high schools to contribute to raising the next generation of materials scientists.

The current strategy for design of granular crystals and other metamaterials focuses on optimizing fixed structures for specific applications such as shock absorption and impact protection.

Textiles are a natural conduit between curvature, topology and everyday life. These innately hierarchical materials have a wealth of emergent geometric and elastic properties, including: soft elasticity at low strain, high extensional rigidity at large strain, low bending modulus, high resistance to global failure, and programmable local curvature. These properties, coupled with cheap, programmable manufacturing techniques make knits prized for industrial and domestic applications. <br/><br/>Each knitted stitch is entangled with its neighbors, creating a locally knotted structure. The topology of these textile ""knots"" creates physical constraints that are responsible for the emergent elasticity of textiles. Previous studies into knitted elasticity have considered only a single type of knitted fabric. However, manipulating the local stitch topology has a profound impact on the elasticity; it can increase or decrease the extensional rigidity, change the crossover between soft elasticity and nonlinear behavior, and even create local topography. <br/><br/>Unlike many coarse-grained physical systems, a satisfactory set of overarching equations that determine the mechanics of textiles is lacking. Understanding the entanglement topology of knitted stitches is key to creating a predictive model of elastic and geometric responses of textiles. This CAREER project will create a framework which unites textile topology with its emergent elasticity. These are broken into two aims: (1) the research team will identify topologically allowed knitted stitches, from which (2) their effect on the local geometry and elasticity of the fabric can be predicted. Techniques from knot theory and 3-manifold topology will be used to create a comprehensive set of stitches. These stitches and their topology will provide the yarn-level basis for an elasticity model. The behavior of each stitch and interactions between stitches will be coarse-grained into a 2D surface model of fabric elasticity. The research team will use anisotropic geometric elasticity theory to relate the local properties of the yarn and the topology of the stitches to the mechanical response of the bulk textile. This framework will be the first set of constitutive relations that govern textile behavior. <br/><br/>This research acts as a conduit between curvature in fabrics and the physics and mathematics of curvature in nature.

This research is targeted towards guiding the processing and design of these alloys for their rapidly expanding use in biomedical devices, aerospace and automotive components, and other applications. Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) will be examined because it is the most widely used and modeled shape memory alloy, and results from this work applied to improving its performance in practice will have the broadest impact. This research will use newly developed experimental approaches - including the ability to measure microscale deformations by tracking nanoparticle assemblies in a scanning electron microscope - to map and understand how these alloys recover large deformations, and what deformation remains permanent. Machine learning approaches will be applied to relate deformations to atomic structure, enabling an improved understanding of the effects of processing and furthering the ability to both model and design shape memory alloy components. In addition to this new information, the techniques developed in this research will be valuable contributions to the experimental mechanics infrastructure that can be used in investigations of a wide host of materials. Several outreach activities are planned, including science days and competitions to introduce students from elementary school to college to experimental mechanics and materials.  <br/> <br/>This research will experimentally characterize the interactions between stress-induced martensitic phase transformation and dislocation slip in polycrystalline shape memory alloys, specifically the impact of microstructure on the nature of these interactions and the superelastic behavior that results. Full-field, high resolution deformation mapping will be combined with high-dimensional clustering and computer vision approaches to segment and identify transformation and slip with respect to microstructure, shedding light on stochastic and deterministic contributions. This research will experimentally address a core difficulty in predicting the behavior of polycrystalline shape memory alloys, which is the existence of strain incompatibilities between the grains. Current constitutive models are largely evaluated by the comparison to experimental stress-strain curves. However, this comparison is not ideal in that it is between two different length scales: macroscopic curves are being compared to micromechanics based models. The results from this research will offer experimental insights into the intragranular interactions that are critical to the behavior of shape memory alloys, experimentally validate the underpinnings of the constitutive models, and quantitatively address hypotheses that are under active debate; such as the hypothesis that transformation and plasticity can occur synergistically, with plasticity providing a bridging mechanism across grains that are poorly oriented for transformation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",399674

For example, increased stiffness will increase wavelength. Stiffness and viscosity can depend on both location and direction. A material with aligned fibers or layers may have different stiffness and viscosity values along the fibers or layers versus across them. Converting wave measurements into a mechanical property map or image is known as reconstruction. Reconstruction in isotropic materials, with the same mechanical properties regardless of direction, is easier than in anisotropic materials, whose properties vary with direction. Transformation Elastography is based on the idea of distorting the material as part of the reconstruction algorithm to make the anisotropic problem become isotropic. This strategy, which has been shown to work in simple two-dimensional reconstruction problems, will be extended to more complex three-dimensional problems. Elastography is a potentially transformative measurement technology for basic research into material mechanics. Extending it to anisotropic materials is essential to advance its application in geophysical exploration, fiber composite analysis, and medical diagnosis of diseases of the brain, skeletal muscle, heart and other organs with aligned fibers for which changes in stiffness and viscosity have been proven to correlate with disease. This research supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health. Research developments will be integrated into courses and multimedia educational materials for a diverse group of students at multiple levels, from K-12 through graduate level engineering.<br/><br/>Elastography relies on a constitutive model of mechanical wave motion in the viscoelastic material to interpret the noninvasive measurements. To make the modeling problem analytically tractable, isotropy and homogeneity are often assumed, and the effects of finite boundaries are ignored. But, infinite isotropic homogeneity is not the situation in most cases of interest, when there are pathological conditions, material faults or hidden anomalies that are not uniformly distributed in fibrous or layered structures of finite dimension. Introduction of anisotropy, inhomogeneity and finite boundaries complicates the analysis forcing the abandonment of analytically-driven strategies, in favor of numerical approximations that are computationally expensive and yield less physical insight. A new strategy, Transformation Elastography, is planned that involves spatial distortion in order to make an anisotropic problem become isotropic.

Currently, the disposal of composite wastes mainly relies on the landfills or incineration, which lead to significant environmental and health burdens. A new green, sustainable recycling method was recently developed to address this problem. It uses a bond-exchange reaction between a solvent and the composite to decompose the polymer material at a mild temperature and reclaim clean fibers. The decomposed products can be used to fabricate new composites with near identical material and mechanical properties for the same applications. However, due to the nascent development of this recycling technique, existing studies are limited to the proof of concept demonstrations. This award supports fundamental studies to uncover the relationships between waste material properties, processing conditions, recycling speed, and final mechanical properties of recycled thermosets and composites. The provided scientific knowledge will pave the road for the immediate applications of this innovative recycling method and significantly ease the environmental and health concerns associated with the traditional waste disposal methods. This research will also impact large-scale applications in other industries involving polymer decomposition and recycling, such as removable encapsulation of electronics, non-destructive surface coatings, controlled drug delivery, membrane science, and microlithography. Additionally, the project will provide opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students with a focus on underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and math.<br/><br/>The research objectives will be realized using an integrated experimental - theoretical - computational approach at multiple length scales: In the microscale, constitutive chemomechanics relations will be defined to link the molecular-level bond-exchange reactions to the evolution of stress field, network structure, and mechanical properties of thermosets during the recycling. In the mesoscale, the constitutive relations will be incorporated into a computational model to study the influences of the fiber-polymer interface on the recycling performance of a composite lamina. In the macroscale, an efficient reduced-order computational model will be developed to guide the selection of solvent and processing conditions to recycle composite structures with the well-controlled geometry and mechanical properties.

As a result, the practical use of metallic glasses as structural materials is currently limited to only a few applications such as eyeglass frames, surgical tools, or golf clubs. In this award, experimental and theoretical approaches are combined to advance our knowledge of the atomic-scale processes governing the response of bulk metallic glasses to deformation. An improved understanding of microstructural damage mechanisms is a necessary pre-requisite to establish structure-property relationships that will allow custom-designed alloys to be produced with characteristics tailored to best match their intended applications. The students working on the project will have the unique opportunity to be trained in an area that combines interdisciplinary skills in micro- and nanomechanics, to perform investigations of materials at the scale of single atoms, to implement new experimental approaches, and to develop novel atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations.

If many such zones aggregate, shear bands can form that localize large shear strain inside a thin region of material. Such shear bands in metallic glasses are analogous to shear planes in crystals. Here, joint experimental and computational modeling studies are employed to investigate the initiation and growth of shear transformation zones, the shear bands they form, and the mechanical properties they control. Towards this end, nanoscale mechanical testing such as indentation and compression will be carried out on samples produced by innovative preparation methods to study how plastic flow is affected by strain rate, sample size, probing volume, and the structural properties of the material during deformation, the results of which will then be compared to computer simulations.

One can think of a hydrogel as a three dimensional ""fishnet"" consisting of gelatin molecular chains (network) swollen by water drawn into the net.     Hydrogels have many current applications such as contact lenses and as scaffolding materials for tissue engineering.  Potential future applications may include artificial cartilage and ""muscles"" for soft robots.  A shortcoming of simple hydrogels is that they are easy to fail; this severely limits their practical use in load bearing components.   In recent years, chemists have invented hydrogels that are highly resistant to fracture.   The network of this new class of hydrogels consists of molecular chains linked to each other by different types of connectors (bonds).   These connectors can be permanent or temporary.   Temporary connectors can break and reform.   This process dissipates energy which contributes to resistance to fracture and they also allow the gel to heal.  Currently, engineers do not have the predictive tools to determine how components made of these hydrogels change shape under load and when they break.  This project will develop such predictive tools.  The end product will be a quantitative method and a computer code which allows engineers to design and analyze components made of these hydrogels.   <br/><br/>Two long standing problems in the time dependent mechanics of deformation and fracture of soft materials are: (1) three dimensional large deformation nonlinear viscoelasticity and (2) efficient integration of these three dimensional nonlinear viscoelastic equations.

This project will address these issues by: (a) performing experiments on a tough Polyampholyte hydrogel, (b) developing quantitative models relating nonlinear viscoelastic behavior to bond breaking and reformation kinetics, (c) developing experimental methods to discover and to quantify crack shielding and (d) developing efficient time integration schemes to solve the nonlinear viscoelastic equations.

The tensile strength of commercial fibers is significantly less than its theoretical limits. The composite systems are often overdesigned, thus any increase in the fiber tensile strength can yield significant cost and weight savings. Modifications of fiber surface treatment (sizing) during manufacturing is a potential route to enhance the fiber strength. Single fiber tensile testing at millimeter-scale is typically used to characterize the effect of sizing on the fiber strength. However, the longitudinal tensile failure of a composite is governed by the fiber strength distribution and defects at microscale lengths. This award supports the fundamental research that overcomes current challenges in characterizing the tensile strength of the fibers at the microscale using experimental and data-driven computational methods. Besides the scientific understanding, this project will also provide a guiding template for the fiber manufacturing process through controlled surface treatment. A direct consequence of improving the tensile strength would be lightweight structures for applications in aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment sectors. As part of this project, a specific effort will also be aimed at recruiting graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups through the Society for Women Engineers at the University of South Carolina. Furthermore, the experimental setup developed in this research will be incorporated into a lab course for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>A comprehensive understanding of the discrepancy between experimental tensile strength of commercial fibers and its theoretical limits has been elusive, and whether intrinsic fiber strength follows a Weibull statistical distribution remains an open question. This research aims to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that govern the tensile strength of fibers at microscale gage lengths. Experimental and data-driven techniques will be employed to study the strength distribution of the fibers at microscales. Microscale gage lengths will be accessed by developing a novel in situ transverse loading experiment on single fibers under scanning electron microscope combined with micro-digital image correlation. Data-driven machine learning techniques will be applied to establish the scaling laws of strength. This research will provide new insights into the functional form of the survival probability and strength-controlling mechanisms in fibers influenced by fiber sizing. This new fundamental knowledge of processing (sizing)-structure (defect distribution)-property (tensile strength distribution) relationship at microscale lengths will enable the establishment of scaling laws for strength and will serve as a guide for fiber manufacturing process to enhance the fiber tensile strength.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",511623

During its useful life-time, a structure is expected to perform within an often severe, and changing environment, whether this is a solid-rocket booster during lift-off; a multi-story building during an earthquake; a grain silo during strong winds; an aircraft wing during turbulence; or an ocean submersible subject to great pressure at depth. The failure of slender cylindrical structures, in particular, is sensitively dependent on small changes in geometry, and when they do fail, usually due to buckling, it is often a sudden and catastrophic event. Due to their unpredictable behavior, they are typically over-designed. This award supports the development of an innovative approach to understanding the buckling of slender structures in general, and hollow cylindrical structures in particular. A more rational basis for assessing load-carrying capability, including appropriate safety factors, will allow more accurate predictions to be made concerning the anticipated useful lifetime of a given structure resulting in tremendous savings. This research is also important for optimizing component replacement, scheduling maintenance based on deteriorating performance, and minimizing material usage. Economic designs and the prevention of disaster are long-term benefits of the research. During the conduct of this research, graduate and undergraduate students will learn a variety of skills including structural testing, mathematical modeling, additive manufacturing, experimental design, and data analysis. Since hollow cylinders are widely used as containers, ranging from soda cans to pipelines to pressurized aircraft fuselages, this project has important impact on national defense and prosperity.<br/><br/>Testing thin cylinders under axial load typically leads to large scatter in the measured buckling load. This has led engineers to rely on relatively conservative design guidelines based on empirical ?knockdown? factors. Rather than trying to predict the exact load at which a highly nonlinear structure will buckle, the major goal of the new approach is to assess the robustness of a structure to shocks or disturbances: a form of configuration-space interrogation. The identification of unstable equilibrium states, and their avoidance, is a key feature of the new stability criteria. 3D-printing will be used extensively. The geometric precision and versatility of 3D-printing is ideally suited to producing a range of high-resolution cylinders that will be thoroughly tested in the laboratory. Numerical simulations will also be conducted for verification purposes.

Quantitative in-situ TEM experiments will be carried out using a novel MEMS device with the strain rate ranging from 0.0001 to 100 /s. Strain rate effects on deformation will be characterized through stress-strain behavior, extraction of activation parameters, and in-situ TEM observation of defect dynamics. A key feature of this collaboration is that the experiments will be complemented by novel atomistic simulations that can access the time scales and strain rates that will be applied experimentally, which will elucidate the atomistic mechanisms underpinning the experimentally- measured mechanical properties and observed deformation mechanisms. Specifically, the simulations will be used to capture both diffusional events, as well as surface nucleation events to not only elucidate the mechanisms by which diffusion contributes to surface dislocation, but also the mechanisms that emerge when diffusive and displacive deformations are simultaneously operant. Finally, the simulations will characterize the localized (brittle) or distributive (ductile) plasticity that emerges from strain-rate-dependent deformation of nanowires containing twin boundaries. This understanding may transform the key technologies, i.e., stretchable electronics, NEMS, and optoelectronics, for which metal nanowires represent a fundamental building block.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",269185

This technology has been developing rapidly but is still limited in practical use due to its high operating temperature. Reducing the SOFC operation temperature towards its widespread applications has triggered an intensive search of super ionic conducting solid oxides. Introducing defects, such as dislocations, into certain oxides has been demonstrated to be promising in achieving a considerably high ionic conductivity at low temperature but this technique is still in a ""trial and error"" stage due to lack of knowledge on how ions hop under the effects of the defect-induced stress field in plastically deformed solid oxides. To meet this need, this award supports fundamental research on computer simulations of ions hopping in defected solid oxides, across a wide range of length scales. The gained knowledge may be utilized in the development of not only low temperature SOFCs, but also lithium/sodium-ion batteries, perovskite solar cells, corrosion-resistant materials for medical implants, and radiation-resistant materials for nuclear power plants. This project is multidisciplinary in nature. The participating students will be exposed to a broad range of scientific knowledge, methodology, and skills. A mentoring program that links the education of graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students will be fostered. <br/><br/>The high operation temperature in SOFC stems from the high ion migration barrier (~1eV) in solid oxides. Distinct from traditional approaches that overcome this barrier by exposing the materials to an elevated temperature, this project presents a plan on promoting ionic transport using severe stress localizations in plastically deformed solid oxides. The local stress's contribution to the ion migration barrier reduction will be quantified through a series of concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) simulations. Polycrystalline strontium titanate and multilayered strontium titanate /magnesium oxide containing a high density of grain boundaries (GBs) and phase boundaries (PBs) will be chosen as the model materials. The CAC simulations will bridge the relevant length scales through resolving the GBs and PBs at an atomistic resolution while the dislocations away from them will be dealt in a coarse-grained description. This will enable a prediction of the microscopic-level ionic transport in strained solid oxides without smearing out the atomistic nature of ion hopping near the material defects. Data and insights regarding diffusion under stress, which controls the kinetics of phase transformations, oxidation, creep, and many other engineering processes in solid materials, will be generated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",433250

This understanding is especially limited for Nickel-Titanium alloys, which are used in such varied applications as biomedical devices and Mars rover tires. This award supports research into the cause of fatigue crack formation which eventually leads to material failure in a Nickel-Titanium material and will create a design tool for enhancing fatigue life.

However, due to microscale defects, Nickel-Titanium is prone to cyclic fatigue cracking. This project builds a crystal plasticity model of Nickel-Titanium and measures crack nucleation around a defect using X-ray micro-tomography and high energy diffraction microscopy. The measured defect geometry is then combined with the model to predict the plastic strain around the measured fatigue crack. Plastic strain plays a key role in fatigue crack nucleation but is difficult to measure; thus, a crystal plasticity model will be used. A data-driven procedure will automate the generation of a fatigue indicator parameter that predicts the mechanical state driving crack nucleation. Fatigue indicator parameters are a commonly proposed tool in the computational design of materials for fatigue resistance; however, current fatigue indicator parameters suffer from inaccuracies, which this project addresses.

The success of this work will lead to a robust and high throughput technique capable of measuring the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of soft gels under wide range of conditions and provide a standard toolbox for engineers to realize quantitative designs based on these materials.

The crosslinks prevent the long polymers from dissolving in the solvent; rather the gel swells and shrinks as the small molecules migrate in and out. The solvent uptake is a two-way street: as the solvent diffuses into the network, the network deforms, leading to size and shape changes, while the deformation of the network also affects the rate and amount of solvent diffusing into or out of the network. Both the concepts and the behaviors of gels are sufficiently complex such that ample room exists for additional work to connect principles of mechanics, thermodynamics, and kinetics to experiments. The proposed study will develop a technique based on an indentation method for characterizing the nonlinear thermodynamic and kinetic properties of gels. The new technique will allow for systematic characterization of various types of stimuli-responsive gels under different environmental conditions.

Atomistic simulations and in-situ transmission electron microscopy will be performed to study the mechanical properties such as yield strength and fracture behavior as well as the associated atomistic processes underlying deformation.

Multiscale materials modeling (MMM) is a branch of computational mechanics, computational biomechanics, and computational materials science in which existing and emerging methods from interdisciplinary fields are combined to bridge phenomena, which are inherent to complex material systems, across different length and time scales. MMM provides direct insights on how materials (or living matter) deform and/or adapt their form and function in response to different mechanical, electrical, magnetic, or environmental exciters, and trace this to material structure and molecular (or cellular) level mechanisms. MMM is also indispensable for expediting the development and manufacturing of reliable materials with superior performance by moving away from empirical trial-and-error techniques, to state-of-the-art and experimentally verified multi-scale computational methods.

To achieve broader use of TMDs across cutting-edge applications, complex deformations for large-area TMDs must be better understood. Large-area TMDs can be simulated and analyzed through predictive modeling, a capability that is currently lacking. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research that overcomes current challenges in large-scale atomistic modeling to obtain an efficient but reliable continuum model for single-layer TMDs containing billions of atoms. The model will be translational and will contribute towards the development of a wide range of applications in the nanotechnology, electronics, and alternative energy industries.

Moreover, existing crystal elastic models for surfaces cannot be applied to multi-atom thick 2D TMDs due to the presence of interatomic bonds across the atomic surfaces. The crystal elastic model aims to solve this problem by projecting all interatomic bonds onto the mid-surface to track their deformations. The actual deformed bonds will, therefore, be computed using the deformations of the mid-surface. Additionally, a technique will be derived to incorporate the effects of curvature and stretching of TMDs on their interactions with substrates. The model will be exercised to generate insights into the mechanical instabilities and the role of substrate interactions on them.

By exploiting this unique electromechanical effect, these materials can function as sensors and actuators, and are found in a broad spectrum of industrial and civil systems including: transportation fuel injectors, structural health monitoring devices, rocket engines and microvalves, to name a few.  One of the main issues with these materials is that they are brittle, and are susceptible to failure from cracking, or fracture.

This kinking behavior has only recently been discovered, yet if understood, has the potential to provide tougher, lighter and more damage-tolerant materials for our nation's aging energy, communication and transportation systems.  As a result, MAX phases will be investigated with varying stacking sequences and layer orientations across a variety of real-world loading conditions, including impact, and dynamic fatigue and fracture.

These materials exhibit a newly classified defect deformation mechanism termed ripplocations, a nanoscale buckling phenomena, which accommodates strain in a different manner than dislocation motion in plasticity or bond rupture in fracture, and leads to the formation of nonlinear kind bands (NKB) under load.  While a notable portion of the materials science community is examining these 3D layered solids, relatively little research exists pursuing their behavior on the meso- to continuum level.  This effort aims to fill that gap through three highly integrated experimental research foci.  The first characterizes deformation behavior varying strain rate and stress states, as well as layer orientation and stacking sequences, utilizing nonlinear buckling theory to determine the driving parameters in NKB formation. The second quantifies crack tip energetics in dynamic fracture leveraging a hybrid experimental-numerical scheme, as well as explores impact fatigue, extending the classic Paris Law for temporal effects.  The third pursues damage behavior, conducting inertial impact experiments exploiting the Grid Method and the Virtual Fields Method, an emerging inverse technique. The extensive investigations on MAX phases will shed light on competing ductile, pseudo-ductile and brittle deformation mechanisms across length and time scales, thus making a significant contribution towards systemically capturing, understanding and optimizing these unique layered solids.

AMLS are hierarchical materials whose effective properties depend upon both the topology of the lattice structure and the base metallic material microstructure. Therefore, understanding the interplay between topology and microstructure is necessary to maximize the potential application of AMLS. In general, one of the major factors that limits a complex engineering system?s performance is that conventional structural metallic materials serve a singular purpose of providing structural support. However, flexibility in the design of AMLS enables an array of multifunctional applications, such as controlled heat transfer, vibration, energy management, and light-weighting. In this research, the potential of AMLS will be enhanced with an in-depth experimental-computational investigation of the combined role of microstructure and topology in the mechanical deformation mechanisms that control the mechanical behavior over a wide range of loading conditions. The educational part of this grant will provide: (1) an opportunity to senior design teams to build educational tools and techniques to teach mechanical engineering concepts to people with visual impairment; and (2) a hands-on research opportunity to low-income students.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are understanding the specific contribution and interplay between the microstructurally driven mechanisms (e.g., those due to grain structures, orientation, and porosity) and geometrically driven events (e.g., unit-cell buckling, node fracturing, and macroscopic shear) on the deformation of AMLS, and determining which mechanisms dominate under different loading conditions. In order to elucidate the specific contribution of local microstructural features relative to topological attributes, experimental data obtained from microstructural and mechanical behavior characterization will be coupled with the local state of stress computed from finite element (FE) simulations. The FE analysis will use a yield criterion that will be customized for AMLS to capture the anisotropic behavior of the struts originating from the repeated solid-phase changes during layer deposition. The new yield criterion will be built based on the strut-level tension, compression, and shear experiments for different microstructures controlled by heat-treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",540001

As the base deforms, so do these embedded scales, which collide and slide against each other leading to the emergence of nonlinear mechanical response and multi-functionality, not typically possible in traditional materials. This research project aims to understand and quantify this structure-property interplay with the help of analytical techniques, multi-scale computational modeling, and experimental validation. Additionally, the education and outreach plan includes several efforts: inclusion of underrepresented students via an institutional STEM center, a unique technology-science fiction event named RoboTales as part of university?s STEM day, and participation in public education via the ?modern machines? night event at the Metropolitan Science Center.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to quantify the structure-property relationships operative in a representative class of exoskeletal structures and discover universal and emergent extreme behavior. Prior work has shown that the rigid biomimetic scales on soft, initially flat substrates give rise to strain stiffening in both bending and twisting modes until a rigid ?locking? state is reached. However, little is known about the generality of these results beyond beam like substrates, limiting their application. Therefore, the PI has two hypotheses: (a) existence of universal kinematic locking?rigid locking behavior across geometry, deformation modes, and sequence and (b) extreme emergent behavior?emergence of multiaxial nonlinear response, broken symmetry with evolution of chirality and anisotropy, and localized locked modes.

This biological characteristic can be attributed to unique microstructures comprising hierarchical geometrical arrangements, spanning several length scales. A unique geometrical characteristic enabling property adaptation is multistability; i.e. a system?s capacity to exhibit several coexisting states.

Building on this hypothesis and departing from considering nearest-neighbor coupling, this research aims to derive long-range interaction models between unit cells. The characteristics of hierarchical multistability opens novel avenues for designing programmable structures that couple sensing, computation and property adaptation.

Based on an analytical mechanical model, a new family of auxetic chiral composites will be invented and their deformation mechanisms will be explored by finite element simulations, micro-polar theory, and mechanical experiments on multi-material 3D-printed specimens. Simultaneously, due to significant local rotation, these new micro-architectured materials provide excellent examples on the application of micro-polar theory and will be used to advance this important theory in mechanics. The rapid development of additive manufacturing (3D printing) enables easy and precise control of the geometry and material composition of micro-architectured hybrid materials, providing unprecedented opportunities to push the boundary of mechanics. This proposed research reveals a paradigm for using 3D printing as a tool to advance existing theories in mechanics and verify new engineering concepts.<br/><br/>The creation of new knowledge on the mechanics of this new family of auxetic chiral composites is expected to have potential broad applications in designing lightweight materials for mechanical protection and energy absorption, biomedical materials and devices to improve public health, and metamaterials and mechano-adaptive composites. The outreach and engagement activities are designed to be integrated with the educational activities and will be largely focused on the engagement and retention of underrepresented groups by threading seemingly traditional mechanical engineering concepts with innovation interdisciplinary concepts.  This will be accomplished by (1) engaging participants across all different levels, from graduate and undergraduate students, elementary and middle school students and teachers to practicing engineers, (2) strengthening curriculum within and across the disciplines of mechanics, biomimetics, and additive manufacturing, (3) collaborating with local, small/middle scale, and high-added value industries to facilitate knowledge dissemination and technology transfer, and (4) developing K-12 outreach activities to support the newly released Next Generation Science Standards.",391347

The mechanical integrity of these interfaces is critical for sustaining electrochemical reactions in the battery systems; consequently, it dictates the long-term performance (or durability) of batteries. Fracture of the polymer/active particle interface electrically isolates active particles and is one of the predominant mechanisms by which capacity fade occurs in batteries, yet the mechanics of this interface failure is the least understood problem. Also, the interfaces in batteries are more complex and their properties change continuously. The novel in situ techniques and fracture criterion developed here will be useful in the validation of multi-physics battery models and development of new electrode material designs for emerging battery technologies that can transform automotive, biomedical, aerospace, and military applications where durability is an important requirement. The integrated education plan includes development of a lab module for students at NJIT that demonstrates the process of stress generation (cause of mechanical damage) during electrochemical cycling processes. This module will be modified and adapted into outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers. This award also enables elementary teacher trainees from the Newark school system to participate in the research. <br/><br/>The polymer/active material interface fracture has been a major roadblock for the rapid advancement of next generation battery electrodes such as Si, Sn, Al, and other large volume change materials. To address these challenges, a combination of novel in situ fracture experiments and supporting models will provide a fundamental understanding of how the interface properties evolve during battery operation and to understand the chemo-mechanical factors that influence the interface fracture behavior. To keep the effort more focused, the interface system in lithium-ion batteries is considered as a model system. A fracture mechanics framework with an interface constitutive model that can incorporate in situ observations, will be developed for prediction of interface failure during an electrochemical reaction. This research will enable interface failure prediction under concurrent mechanical and electrochemical loading using the fracture mechanics models; hence, it lays the groundwork for the essential fundamental understanding to develop long cyclic life, low-cost, and durable batteries for a diverse range of applications.",287575
